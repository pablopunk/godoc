# GoDocÂ 

Use your github README as a website. Example: https://godoc.now.sh/pablopunk/godoc

## Usage

Just append `<your-user>/<your-repo>` to `godoc.now.sh` and you will see your readme right there.

You can also use an alternative **dark mode**. Just append `?dark` to your url. Example: https://godoc.now.sh/pablopunk/iga?dark

## Use your custom domain

For example, I deployed [pablopunk.com](https://pablopunk.com) in order to redirect subfolders to GoDoc:

> [pablopunk.com/iga](https://pablopunk.com/iga) redirects to `godoc.now.sh/pablopunk/iga?dark`

Notice the GoDoc url is kind of large, but with my custom domain, I can have it nice and short even with dark mode.
