# GoDocÂ 

Use your github README as a website. Example: https://godoc.now.sh/pablopunk/godoc

Just append `<your-user>/<your-repo>` to `godoc.now.sh` and you will see your readme right there.

You can also use an alternative **dark mode**. Just append `?dark` to your url. Example: https://godoc.now.sh/pablopunk/iga?dark
